GMAP API DOCUMENTATION

The gmap API allows other modules to integrate Google Maps into their
Drupal Site.  It can also be used by theme developers to integrate Google
maps into portions of their theme.

It can also be used to insert a map into any block of php.

INSTALLATION

To install the gmap API you must install the GMap.module.

1) copy the gmap directory into the modules directory

2) edit the theme files to ensure that the html file has the following at
   the top of each page (the first one  is recommended by Google, the
   second is required for the lines overlays to work in IE:
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml">

3) Get a GMap API Key at http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

4) enable the 'gmap module' in drupal

5) edit admin/settings/gmap to include the key you received from google and
   change any other default setting.
   
If you are not using the filter built into the gmap.module and you do not
intend to insert google maps into nodes, then you can use the "Dynamic"
setting which will only load the google javascript on pages with Google
maps.


PROGRAMMING API

There are two different methods of inserting a Google Map using the gmap
API.  The first is using a macro as can be built from the macro creator
included as part of this module.  The second uses the gmap associative
array to define the Google Map function.

Macro

The macro is straight with each variable separated by a "|" and then uses
an "=" to define that variable.  Possible parameters are:

  id - the id for the map.  Each map on a page must have a unique id.
  center - The comma separated latitude and longitude of the centre of
       the map.
  width - width of the map
  height - height of the map
  zoom - the zoom factor of the google map
  align - the alignment of the map 'right', 'left' or 'center'
  control - the control shown on the map 'Large', 'Small', or 'None'
  type - 'Map', 'Hybrid' or 'Satellite'
  points/markers - a string of points to mark on the map with + between
        each point
  line - the line is defined by a set of points separated by a +
  track - Draws a line based on the points in the .plt file
  feed - the RSS feed with geo:lat information to be parsed by js

The following shape types require XMaps:  (xmaps is not currently functioning)
  circle - a circle based on a center point and a radius in km separated
          by a + and optionally can include the number of sizes.
  rpolygon - a regular polygon is defined by the center point and a point
          on the permiter separated by a +
  polygon - a polygon is defined by a set of points

For a more detailed explanation on how to make complicated macros see:
  http://webgeer.com/gmapdemo
  
You can convert a macro into a gmap array with the function
gmap_parse_macro($instring,$ver=2) $ver is only required if you need to
use a macro generated with an old version of gmap where the format was
longitude, latitude (set to 1 in that case).
  
Gmap Array

The GMap Array is an associative array with the following definitions:

  id - the id of the map every map on a page must have a unique id
  width - width of the map should be either 'px' or '%'
  height - height of the map
  latitude - a string of the latitude of the centre of the map
  longitude - a string of the longitude of the centre of the map
  zoom - the zoom factor of the google map
  align - the alignment of the map 'right', 'left' or 'center'
  control - the control shown on the map 'Large', 'Small', or 'None'
  tcontrol - whether the type control is on the map or not: 'off' or 'on'
  scontrol - whether the scale control is on the map or not: 'off' or 'on'
  ocontrol - the 'width,height' of the overview map control
  type - 'Map', 'Hybrid' or 'Satellite'
  drag - 'yes' or 'no' map is draggable.  Default is 'yes'
  markers - an array of marker arrays.  Each marker array is an associative
    array with the following elements:
      'latitude' - the latitude of the marker
      'longitude' - the longitude of the marker
      'markername' - the marker icon to use. For example if it is set
        to 'number', then the icons in the marker directory named
        'number1.png', 'number2.png' etc.  will be used. If these don't
        exist 'number.png' would be used.  If that doesn't exist then
        the default marker will be used.  (optional)
      'label' - html text to be located in a pop-up window when you click
        on the marker.
  shapes - an array of shape arrays.  Each shape array can have the
    following elements:
      'type' -  'line', 'circle', 'rpolygon', or 'polygon'
      'color' - the hex for the color to create the line (eg. '#00dd00')
      'width' - the width of the line in px
      'opacity' - between 0 and 1 for the opacity of the line
      'pattern' - a broken line definition '20 5 10 5' would mean 20 px
         long line, 5x break, 10px line 5px break 20px line ...
         (xmaps objects only)
      'text' - the text used in the line (xmaps only)
      'fillcolor' - the fill color for filled objects (xmaps objects only)
      'fillopacity' - the opacity of the filled objects (xmaps object only)
  tracks - an array of track arrays.  Each track array can have the
    following elements:
      'filename' - a filename for the track (.plt) file.  Should be
         relative to the drupal base url.
      'type', 'color', etc... same as the shape line.
  feeds - an array of feed arrays.  Each feed array can have the
    following elements:
      'url' - the url of the feed.
      'markername' - the marker icon to use.  same as for markers
         except that numbered markers are not supported.
  wmss - an array of WMS services arrays.  Each WMS service array can have the
    following elements:
      'name' - the name of the custom map (no spaces or special chars).
      'url' - the url of the WMS service.
      'format' - image format to retrieve. Depends of WMS service:
         'image/gif','image/png','image/jpeg'
      'layers' - a comma separated list of layers advertized by WMS service
         to show in this custom map.
      'minresolution' - lowest zoom level of this custom map.
      'maxresolution' - highest zoom level of this custom map.
      'copyrights' - an array of copyrights to display. Each copyright array
         can have the following elements:
           'minzoom' - lowest zoom level at which this information applies.
           'bounds' - a comma separated list of coordinates defining a
              region to which this copyright information applies: 'S,W,N,E'
           'text' - text of the copyright message.
      'overlaywith' - (optional) overlay WMS layers with this Google layers:
         'Map', 'Hybrid', 'Satellite' or 'None'(default)
      'merczoomlevel' - (optional) zoom factor of the google map where WMS service
         should advertize layers in Transverse Mercator projection instead
         of WGS84 projection. See discussion of this topic here:
         http://johndeck.blogspot.com/#112679047816546118
      'opacity' - (optional) Opacity level for this tile from 0.0 (transparent)
         to 1.0 (opaque)

The gmap marker is converted to the javascript to display the map using the
function gmap_draw_map($gmap, $javascript=''), where $gmap is a map
variable and javascript is some javascript to be run when the map is
loaded.  Note that the string '{mapid}' in the javascript will be
replaced with the mapid of the map being drawn.

It should be noted that the default map settings provided on the
admin/settings/gmap page will be used for any value that is not provided.
